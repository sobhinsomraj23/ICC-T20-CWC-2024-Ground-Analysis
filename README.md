This project focuses on analyzing various aspects of the T20 World Cup 2024 to uncover insights and patterns that can inform strategic decisions. The analysis includes several key areas:

Toss Analysis: Understanding the impact of winning the toss on match outcomes.                                                                                                     
Venue Analysis: Examining performance trends based on different venues.                                                                                                            
Team-Based Analysis: Assessing the performance of each team in various scenarios.                                                                                                 
Win Percentage and Average Win Margin: Analyzing the win rates and average winning margins across different group stage matches.



Tools & Visualizations:
The analysis was conducted using Power BI, leveraging a range of visual tools to bring data insights to life:
Slicer: Used to filter data and interact with different dimensions dynamically.                                                                                                   
Stacked Column Chart: Visualizes team performance across different categories.                                                                                                     
Map Chart: Geographically displays venue-based analysis.                                                                                                                           
Gauge: Measures key performance indicators like win percentage.                                                                                                                    
Pie Chart: Illustrates proportional data, such as win distribution among teams.
